# BlueboardStickC
Allow iRig blueboard to work with Spark 40 amp

You need an M5 Stack Stick C and an iRig Blueboard and a Spark 40 amp

And you need to start the Blueboard in MIDI C mode (turn on holding C down)!   


There are two sets of code here:   
   StickSparkBlueBoard    This is the basic code to connect to the Blueboard and Spark, but doesn't allow app connectivity    
   SparKBlueBoard         This is the full code to allow Blueboard, Spark and app to connect simultaneously
